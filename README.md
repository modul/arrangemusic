Arrangemusic
============
Creates hierarchical directory structure of music files based on tag information.

This script takes an audio file or a whole directory of those, renames them and creates a directory structure 
like Artist/Album/track.ext

The script renames files, creates directories, moves files and directories to a specified target directory, 
replaces  characters in file names that you don't want, informs you when files seem to already exist, takes 
care of articles in artist names and so on.
Default values, command line options, multiple directory/file renaming patterns and more can be changed and 
saved in a configuration file.
